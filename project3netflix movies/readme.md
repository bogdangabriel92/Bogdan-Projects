# ðŸŽ¬ Investigating Netflix Movies (1990s)

This project explores movie data from Netflix to analyze trends in movie durations and genres from the 1990s decade.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: `netflix_data.csv` 
- **Description**: Contains information about movies and TV shows on Netflix, including:
  - `title`, `genre`, `duration`, `release_year`, `country`, etc.

---

## Analysis Performed

### Main Steps:
1. **Data filtering**: Kept only rows where `type == "Movie"` and `release_year` in the 1990s (1990â€“1999).
2. **Duration distribution**: Created a histogram to visualize the most common movie durations.
3. **Short action movies**: Counted how many action movies from the 1990s have a duration < 90 minutes.

### Visualization:
- Matplotlib was used to plot a histogram of movie durations from the 1990s.
- Most frequent movie duration: **~100 minutes**
- Short action movies in the 1990s: **`N` movies** *(dynamically calculated)*
